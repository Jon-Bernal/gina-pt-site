	<h3>Education</h3>

	<p>
		Gina began her education with a BS in Athletic Training, where she learned first hand the
		importance of maintaining a person’s physical ability and how to manage acute injuries. She then
		earned her Masters in Sports Management to better understand the business side of athletics and
		clinic management. It was during this time that Gina discovered her love of physical therapy
		through a chance conversation with a PT, and returned to undergrad to complete her
		pre-requisites to apply to PT school. Gina finished her education with a Doctorate of Physical
		Therapy in 2018 upon completing clinical rotations in post-surgical rehab, inpatient acute care,
		outpatient orthopedics, and outpatient neurological rehab.

	<h3>Continuing Education and Career Goals</h3>
	<p>
		After graduation Gina worked in a trauma level II hospital, floating to all floors with her
		primary being acute care and post-op. During this time she also worked in the outpatient chronic
		pain and degenerative conditions clinic. Early on Gina learned of Fascial Counterstrain, a
		manual therapy that has helped fill in the gaps of traditional PT, and has since completed 12
		courses of this technique. After two years in a hospital setting, Gina fully transitioned to
		outpatient orthopedics with her move to Whidbey Island. Her continuing education goals are to
		complete the Fascial Counterstain course load and to become certified in this technique. She
		also plans to pursue continuing education in Feldenkrais therapy and HeartMath.

	<h3>Personal Knowledge of Healthcare</h3>
	<p>
		Gina has a first-hand understanding of orthopedic injuries, chronic conditions, and holistic
		care. During her time as a collegiate athlete in cross country and track, Gina sustained low
		back and knee injuries that nearly ended her career in running. She has also contended with mast
		cell activation syndrome (MCAS), an autoimmune disorder which causes the body to react
		aggressively to environmental and food irritants. Chronic fatigue, chronic full body edema,
		eczema, and asthma are a few of the symptoms seen with this condition. After trying multiple
		types of medications and being housebound with no positive results, Gina turned to acupuncture
		with little hope of recovery. After a long assessment, her acupuncturist recommended a course of
		recovery with a multi-system approach. Since implementing this, Gina has regained her ability to
		work and participate in life fully while still managing her condition. It has been through this
		experience that Gina has learned the importance of addressing all aspects of health and not just
		the physical side.

	<h3>What I Do Outside of Physical Therapy</h3>
	<p>
		For fun Gina enjoys spending time with her husband and their four house rabbits. She frequently
		goes hiking, paddle boarding, and rock climbing. When she’s not outside, Gina can be found
		reading, embroidering, and watching movies. She particularly likes Marvel, Star Trek, and
		comedies of all kinds.
