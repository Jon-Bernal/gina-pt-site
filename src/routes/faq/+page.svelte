				<Accordion.Trigger>What Does a Physical Therapist Do?</Accordion.Trigger>
				<Accordion.Content>
					<p>
						I provide therapy in orthopedics rehab, whether you are recovering from an injury or are
						wanting to gain the ability to do more physical activity. This includes exercise that
						focuses both on individual muscles as well as muscle chains and groups. I work to build
						the body up from the basics to ensure there is no oversight of underlying causes of pain
						and injury. This then allows the body the best opportunity to achieve its full
						potential.
					</p>
					<p>
						I work with the healing process of inflammation. This includes inflammation management
						through ice/heat, TENS unit usage, and manual therapy. I maximize the opportunities
						available during the healing cycles with the various techniques listed here.
					</p>
					<p>
						I also provide Fascial Counterstrain, a hands-on treatment that aids the body in
						recovery by releasing inflammation and releasing tension of connective tissues
						throughout.

				<Accordion.Trigger>What is Fascial Counterstrain?</Accordion.Trigger>
				<Accordion.Content>
					<p>
						Fascial Counterstrain (FCS) is the application of hands-on manual therapy to release
						contractions of your tissues, such as muscles, ligaments, and nerves. When there is
						tissue tension, this can cause pain and dysfunction. By releasing these tissues, the
						body can move more appropriately and release inflammation. This is a painless technique
						and has the ability to affect any system in the body, including lymphatics, visceral
						organs, bone, and more. Learn more about FCS <a href="https://counterstrain.com/"
							>here</a
						>.

				<Accordion.Trigger>Do you take insurance or Medicare?</Accordion.Trigger>
				<Accordion.Content>
					<p>
						At this time, I do not accept insurance or Medicare. I am however happy to provide a
						superbill so that you may request reimbursement from your insurance provider. Medicare
						rules state that those who are medicare beneficiaries cannot pay “out of pocket” for
						physical therapy. However, there are circumstances that allow a person with Medicare to
						pay privately. Please email for more details.

			<Accordion.Item value="item-4">
				<Accordion.Trigger>What are my options for payment?</Accordion.Trigger>
				<Accordion.Content>
					<p>
						Payment is due at the time of service for all appointments, and I can provide a
						superbill upon request. For those with a Health Savings Account (HSA) or a Flexible
						Spending Account (FSA) you may also use this as a form of payment if physical therapy is
						determined to be necessary by your doctor.

			<Accordion.Item value="item-5">
				<Accordion.Trigger>Why choose to pay privately for physical therapy?</Accordion.Trigger>
				<Accordion.Content>
					<p>
						I have chosen to provide physical therapy out of network in order to stay aligned with
						my values and ethics for patient care. This allows me to address a person’s needs as
						they arise rather than being isolated to one part of the body at a time. Paying
						privately also allows me to treat for longer periods of time per session and allows me
						to treat a person for as many sessions as they need to heal. Treating someone for longer
						sessions provides more time to address all aspects of care, and reduces the number of
						appointments needed to achieve the patient’s goals.

			<Accordion.Item value="item-8">
				<Accordion.Trigger>Do I need a referral for physical therapy?</Accordion.Trigger>
				<Accordion.Content
					><p>
						You do not need a referral to see a physical therapist in the state of Washington as we
						are a “direct access” state. If you plan to submit for reimbursement to your insurance
						company, you may be required to have a referral to receive reimbursement. You may also
						have a limited number of visits for physical therapy per year. Be sure to check with
						your insurance provider on what your benefits cover.

			<Accordion.Item value="item-9">
				<Accordion.Trigger>What is your approach to patient care?</Accordion.Trigger>
				<Accordion.Content>
					<p>
						My approach is to appreiciate all aspects of healthcare. While I am only licensed to
						provide physical therapy, I will recommend other types of therapy and practitioners of
						these therapies as the need arises. I believe in being honest and open about what I am
						seeing, and from there providing options for my patients to explore to further help them
						along their health journey. I recognize that many people have had unpleasant experiences
						in the healthcare system, and have suffered trauma from this. I promise to ensure my
						patients feel safe, heard, and understood (regardless of ethnicity, gender identity,
						sexuality, ability, or other interdival identities) when working with me.

			<Accordion.Item value="item-10">
				<Accordion.Trigger>Are we a good fit to work together?</Accordion.Trigger>
				<Accordion.Content
					><p>
						I look at physical therapy as a team effort. I will do everything in my power to help
						someone heal, but I cannot do it alone. If the patient is unable to fully participate
						(within reason), I will not be able to continue working with them as we will struggle to
						see results. If you want to dive deep into your health and are willing to be responsible
						for your health, we can achieve great results.
